# üó£Ô∏è About
AI-powered Chrome extension for learning new languages on the Farcaster client, Warpcast. 

This is the first language-learning app native to Warpcast and introduces a gamification element that brings more people onchain. The quiz questions and learning content are AI-powered, so it can adapt to different users' individual learning styles. It also works for any language!

Most importantly, this app provides a **real-world** learning experience! Traditional language-learning apps drill you with generic vocabulary and basic sentences. With Castlingo, we provide a more realistic and practical approach by directly translating text that people wrote! Learning from these translations gives a better background of words and phrases you'll actually use, especially crypto-native terms since it's on Warpcast!

‚ûî Chrome API: fetches the current tab's URL

‚ûî Neynar API: fetches a cast's text given a URL input

‚ûî OpenAI API: returns a JSON object of the translation, definitions, and quiz questions given the cast's text

‚ûî Next.js: game logic, UI states, and general functionality of the extension

‚ûî MicroGPT: VS Code extension used to enhance workflow + improve code quality

I used this [starter template](https://github.com/ibnzUK/next-chrome-starter) for the Next.js extension. This [blog](https://nextjsstarter.com/blog/nextjs-chrome-extension-a-developers-guide/) provides a good overview of how to get started. This [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FENxgQ58JSE) video and this [content scripts + service workers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfNL9e-u8xU) video were both very useful.

# üó∫Ô∏è Road Map
1. Farcaster-native experience: leverage Farcaster frames + cast actions so users don't have to install another extension, making the entire experience in-app. This also opens up the game to both web and mobile users.
2. Leaderboard: gamify the experience with a social aspect by introducing a leaderboard where users can compete with points + streaks.
3. Onchain rewards: win NFTs + USDC for streaks + points, and compete or bet against against friends to earn more rewards. This introduces a viral loop to get more users.
